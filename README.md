# CCC-PONG

Group Name: Calgary Coding Chads

This is a modded pong game. Each member of the group created one mod to add into the game.

1. Jordan's mod: when the moving buff wall is hit, the ball bounces the opposite way off the bottom and top of the screen until the buff wall is hit again. 
2. Shargeel's mod: when the powerup is hit, the ball increases in size for about 10 seconds, then it goes back to normal
