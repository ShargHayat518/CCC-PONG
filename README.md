# CCC-PONG

Group Name: Calgary Coding Chads

This is a modded pong game. Each member of the group created one mod to add into the game.

1. Anro's mod: Created moving buff wall which gives the player/opponent to splash each other with freaky RGB lights. (Default Wall Color = Yellow, Player wall color = Green, Opponent Wall Color = Red). The wall buff has a randomized direction.

2. Jordan's mod: When the moving buff wall is hit, the ball bounces the opposite way off the bottom and top of the screen until the buff wall is hit again. 

3. Peter's mod: Created a goal post behind the paddles which are red. Balls are now bounceable on every wall. The objective is to hit the red goal paddle. Both goal posts start from top to bottom and then teleports back to the top when it reaches bottom of the screen

4. Shargeel's mod: when the powerup is hit, the ball increases in size for about 10 seconds, then it goes back to normal

5. CJ's mod: When either the opponent of the player is behind by 3 points, the losing side will have increased paddle speed until the difference between the two scores is less than 3
